A Telegram groups, channels and bots aggregator. This is a remake of [tg-list-old](https://github.com/PabloDinella/tg-list-old), using JavaScript stack.

This is my main pet project right now. I will use it to practice my coding skills, new tech, and any other aspect concerning the journey of creating a product (even though this is a toy project).
