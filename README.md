# tg-list.now.sh

A Telegram groups, channels and bots aggregator. This is a remake of [tg-list-old](https://github.com/PabloDinella/tg-list-old), using JavaScript stack.

This is my main pet project right now. I will use it to practice my coding skills and every aspect concerning the journey of creating a product.

## Things I want to learn/accomplish with this project

- [ ] 100% unit test coverage
- [ ] CI with now.sh *(I never did from scratch)*
- [ ] Acceptance testing *(I never did from scratch)*
- [ ] SEO
